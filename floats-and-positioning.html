<p>These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
<div class="box2"></div><p>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>

<p>And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p>
<p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Who are you, my warranty?! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>
<p>Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? With gusto. Is that a cooking show? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Say what?</p>
<p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! You know, I was God once. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</p>
<p>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</p>
<p>Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</p>
<p>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</p>
<p>Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. What are their names? Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. No. We're on the top. Is the Space Pope reptilian!?</p>
