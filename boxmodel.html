<h1>Box Model Goodness</h1>

    <p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>

    <p>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Can we have Bender Burgers again? Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</p>

    <p> Put her in the brig. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Okay, I like a challenge. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.
    </p>
    <p>Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>

    <p>Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>

    <p>Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-three">
    <p>Why would I want to know that? No! The cat shelter's on to me. What are their names? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Negative, bossy meat creature!</p>

    <p>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Ooh, name it after me! You know, I was God once. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p>
</div>

<div id="section-four">
    <p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! One hundred dollars. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>
    <p>Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! You lived before you met me?! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-five">
    <p>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Actually, that's still true.</p>
    <p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Oh yeah, good luck with that.</p>
